Arithmetic Operator
+
/
-
% - modulus gives remainder
// - double frontslash gives floor. it remove the float value for eg: 2/3 gives 0.6666 
but // floor division only gives answer without float number answer of 2//3 is 0.
* - exponent which gives power

Logical Operator
AND , OR , NOT

Identity Operator
is. isNot

for int 
a = 1
b = 1
a == b 
b == a
prints both true on shell because object and int address memory is same for both a and b for integer datatype

a = []
b = []
a is b  # print false
b is a  # print false because list has different address memory
a == b
b == a # prints true

# Memorship Operator
in and not in operator 
testng in list
a = [1,4,5,6]
5 in a #Prints true as 5 is present in a list
555 in a # prints false as 555 is not present as elements inside the list a 
8989 not in a # prints true as not in Memorship operator is used return true

"A" not in a #prints true because python is case sensitive 

# Bit wise operator (used in low level machine level programming )
- left shift, right shift, x-or, or
