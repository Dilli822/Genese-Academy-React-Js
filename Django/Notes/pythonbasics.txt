Operators Precedence
- same as math badmass rule 
- (2+3)/5
- 5/5
- 1.0

Operator Associtivity for exponent case in python
- 2**3**2
- first 3**2 gives 9 and 2**9 gives 512
-(2**(3**2)) also gives 512
--- from above we knew that for exponent operator associativity is not left associtivity but it is
--- right associtivity.

Python Keywords
Python version 3 has 33 keywords.
Identifier
Name of variable and identifier must not use first character as number i.e.
5variable --- wrong
Variable5 --- correct

Valid Identifiers
VarName
Var98
_var

Invalid Identifiers
98var
n@gmae
Def

-- Check either it is keyword or not
Import keyword
keyword.iskeyword("def")
True
keyword.iskeyword("hello")
False

--- check either it is identifier or not with python
With the help "identifier".isidentifier() we can check either it is identifier or not
"Name".isidentifier()
True
"n@df".isidentifier()
False
"Def".isidentifier()
False

---Comments in python----
With hash # we can comment the python
#single line comment
""" This is multi line comment """
The concept of multi line is almost not supported by other languages like c,c++,javascript.
We call it multi line string the character inside the quotes. """ """

----- EPISlION IN PYTHON gives smallest possible difference in python floating number addition.
>>> 1.8+0.1
>>> 1.9000000000000001
-- this means
>>> 1.8+0.1 == 1.9
False

-- this may bring issues and bugs in our code while in production.so we must be aware and careful while we are doing operation on floating numbers.
- It is good practice to use round while performing arithmetic operation on floating numbers in python.
>>> import sys
>>> ((1.8+0.1) == sys.float_info.epsilon )
False
>>> import sys
>>> ((1.8+0.1) - 1.9 == sys.float_info.epsilon)
True
